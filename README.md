I have created a Spotify Clone to showcase my skills and projects. To achieve this, I implemented the following - 



## HTML
I created spotify clone body using html tag  

## CSS Grid & Flexbox 
I created fluid layouts throughout the page with a mixture of Grid and Flexbox. The app is fully responsive on multiple screen widths.



## JavaScript
I created functions to animate the navbar or the section titles, depending on the scroll position on the page.
